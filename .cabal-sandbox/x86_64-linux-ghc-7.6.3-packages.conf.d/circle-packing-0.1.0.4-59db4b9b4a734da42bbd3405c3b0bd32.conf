synopsis: Simple heuristic for packing discs of varying radii in a circle
description: Given a number of circles with their radii, this packags
             tries to arrange them tightly, without overlap and forming a
             large circle.
             .
             Finding the optimal solution is NP hard, so only
             heuristics are feasible. This particular
             implementation is neither very good nor very fast,
             compared to the state of the art in research. Nevertheless
             it is simple to use and gives visually acceptable results.
             .
             Contributions of better algorithms are welcome.
