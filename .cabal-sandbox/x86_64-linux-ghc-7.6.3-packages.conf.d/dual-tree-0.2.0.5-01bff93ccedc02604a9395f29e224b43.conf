synopsis: Rose trees with cached and accumulating monoidal annotations
description: Rose (n-ary) trees with both upwards- (/i.e./
             cached) and downwards-traveling (/i.e./
             accumulating) monoidal annotations.  This is used
             as the core data structure underlying
             the @diagrams@ framework
             (<http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams>), but
             potentially has other applications as well.
             .
             Abstractly, a DUALTree is a rose (n-ary) tree
             with data (of type @l@) at leaves, data (of type
             @a@) at internal nodes, and two types of monoidal
             annotations, one (of type @u@) travelling \"up\"
             the tree and one (of type @d@) traveling
             \"down\".
             .
             See "Data.Tree.DUAL" for full documentation.
             "Data.Tree.DUAL" provides a public API which
             should suffice for most purposes.
             "Data.Tree.DUAL.Internal" exports more of the
             internal implementation---use it at your own
             risk.
